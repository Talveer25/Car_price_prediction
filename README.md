**Used Car Price Evaluation Project**
Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate predictive models for estimating the prices of used cars based on various factors. It explores key attributes such as mileage, vehicle age, make, and model, among others, and implements machine learning techniques to predict the resale value of a car. Additionally, data exploration and cleaning steps are performed to enhance the quality of the dataset for model building.

**Dataset**
The dataset includes used car details with variables such as:

Make name: The brand and specific model of the car.
Year: The manufacture year of the car.
Mileage: The total distance traveled by the car.
Condition: The condition of the car, e.g., excellent, good, or fair.
Engine Displacement: The engine size, which can affect both performance and fuel economy.
Fuel type: The type of fuel the car uses, such as gasoline or diesel.
Price: The target variable indicating the car's resale value.
Project Highlights
The project covers the following key components:
**
Data Exploration:**

Summary statistics of the dataset.
Detection of outliers and extreme values through box plots.
Handling missing data using appropriate imputation methods.
**Data Visualization:**

Histograms to explore variable distributions such as price, mileage, and fuel economy.
Correlation analysis to understand relationships between different features like horsepower, engine displacement, and price.
**Predictive Modeling:**

Linear Regression and Decision Tree models are implemented to predict the price of used cars.
Evaluation metrics like RMSE are used to assess model performance.
**Methods Used**
Missing Value Handling: Missing values for critical features like mileage and fuel economy are imputed using the mean, ensuring that data loss is minimized.
Feature Encoding: Categorical variables such as body type, fuel type, and transmission are transformed using one-hot encoding for predictive modeling.
Outlier Detection: Box plots are used to identify extreme values in the dataset that may affect model accuracy.
Correlation Analysis: Positive and negative correlations between features such as engine size, horsepower, and fuel economy are explored to determine their influence on price.
**Results**
The predictive models, especially the decision tree model, demonstrated good accuracy in estimating used car prices. Features like engine displacement, horsepower, mileage, and car age were key determinants in predicting price.
